# Email-Downloader

Email Downloader is a PHP application/concept used to download Emails from your inbox. It also downloads the attachments that you get with your Email.

Email Downloader currently supports POP3 and IMAP Email accounts.

You can view your email contents once downloaded. The email body message is viewable, whether it is in HTML or plain text, as it is. Itâ€™s just like viewing it from your Outlook/Gmail/Hotmail/etc inbox.
